# Identify Customer Segments with Arvato 
Third and final project for the Udacity Intro to Machine Learning nanodegree

In this project, I applied my unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments
of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data that you will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.
