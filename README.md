# Identify Customer Segments with Arvato 
Third and final project for the Udacity Intro to Machine Learning nanodegree

In this project, I applied my unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments
of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany.
These segments could be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences with the highest expected rate of returns.
The data used for this project has been provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.

Although there were precise guidelines in the project, there were also places where an exact specification is not provided. I also needed to make and justify my own decisions on how to treat the data. These are places where there multiple ways to handle the data since there may be many valid ways to approach an analysis task in real life. One of the most important things here wast to clearly document my approach so that others can understand my decisions.

# Unsupervised Learning Methods
1 - principal component analysis   
2 - K-means clustering   

# Dataset
Unfortunately, the dataset is not availiable here since it is private to its parent comapany.
